# amc_SocNetAPI_NoSQL

# Description

 This API allows users to be created, and deleted. It allows users to comment, or "thought", and react to those thoughts -- theirs, or others, and also allows users to edit their own thoughts, and reactions. It also allows users to add and delete other users from their friends list as well. It is a database that creates and holds new data as it is added, deleted, or updated.

# Installation

In terminal, type npm i for installation of dependencies 
and then npm start to be connected to localhost
For this particular challenge, I was having trouble with the versions, I think. I got errors on setup, however, it still connected to the local host and I was able to see everything on Insomnia.

Josh Hale (part of the coding bootcamp cohort) helped me author code and share his own in order to troubleshoot a lot of the errors I was having.
